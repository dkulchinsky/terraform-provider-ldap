# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Provides an LDAP entry. This can be used to create, modify, and delete LDAP entries.

Two special handlings are implemented (somehow in deviation from the generic approach in this provider):

The read function for the resource uses
[NewSearchRequest](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-ldap/ldap/v3@v3.4.5#NewSearchRequest) to read the entry 
and thus a filter has to be specified.
Therefor `(objectClass=*)` is used as a filter not filtering anything 
(each entry has an objectClass as specified in [RFC 4512 Section 3.3.](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.html#section-3.3)).

The read function for the resource ignores the attribute corresponding to the relative part (RDN) of the DN (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.html#section-2.3).
This is necessary because this part is added as attribute to the LDAP entry by the LDAP server but is not specified in the terraform code.
By now this only supports single valued RDNs (s. https://github.com/l-with/terraform-provider-ldap/issues/34). 
In the example below the LDAP attribute `uid` is ignored on read because `uid=jimmit01` is the RDN 
and the attribute `uid` with the value `jimmit01` is added implicitely by the LDAP server (although not part of `data_json`).

## Example Usage
{{ tffile (printf "examples/resources/%s/resource.tf" .Name)}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

Since terraform version 1.5.x there is an experimental feature 
[Generating configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration).

### Example Usage

```terraform
import {
  to = ldap_entry.test
  id = "uid=jimmit01,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
}
```

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_resources.tf
```
